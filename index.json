That means die application itself was answering on ipv4. Also, I know that ipv4 and ipv6 are not campatible at all. If you wanted ipv4 server to speak with ipv6 and vice versa you need NAT641, which translates ipv4 and ipv6 traffic.\nI was confused\u0026hellip;\nIt turns out the socket itself is an ipv6 socket. I also did not know that there is a special ipv6 address range which maps to ipv4 addresses.2 That means all ipv4 adresses are also ipv6 adresses.3\nSo these sockets work with ipv4 but since they are really ipv6 sockets they are listed as tcp6 in netstat.\nThe more you know.\n   Wikipedia - NAT64 \u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n  Wikipedia - IPv4-mapped IPv6 addresses \u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n  StackExchange - netstat â€” why are IPv4 daemons listening to ports listed only in -A inet6? \u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n  ","date":1589956200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1589956200,"objectID":"6e0a54754a244a01e099160946ab3e7b","permalink":"https://www.ajfriesen.com/post/netstat-shows-tcp6/","publishdate":"2020-05-20T08:30:00+02:00","relpermalink":"/post/netstat-shows-tcp6/","section":"post","summary":"Why netstat shows tcp6 sockets even though you only have ipv4 configured.\n","tags":["networking","netstat","tcp6","ipv6","linux"],"title":"Netstat shows tcp6 on ipv4 only host","type":"post"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"I have worked with Kubernetes the last 2 years on AWS with Rancher2 and just want to jot down some notes.

There are some others like OpenShift from Red Hat with different features.\nThe distribution will run Kubernetes opinionated so you do not have to think of every detail.\nExample:\nKubernetes does not come with a user management system. You could implement this your own or just pick a distribution which has done all the work for you. Rancher comes with different authentication providers like GitHub, Azure AD and others. It is baked in. Just configure the authentication in Rancher, OpenShift or your Kubernetes distribution of choice and that is it.\nSince it is opinionated, it may not fit your use case. Maybe you just need to dig a little deeper into the configuration options that depends on your needs.\nFeatures Rancher will give you:\n User management, since Kubernetes does not have user management backed in A neat web interface to browse your clusters (yes, I mean several clusters!) Provision to major cloud providers (AWS, Google, Azure), bare metal, vmware vSphere etc. Kubernetes Cluster backups, upgrades, etc. One place to manage a lot  Listing all features of Rancher does not make sense here.\nI just want you to know, that all lot is taken care of and that is the real reason to choose a Kubernetes distribution. This is basic and important stuff which you would need to implement by yourself. Pick your flavor and go with it like Linux distributions ðŸ˜‰.\nrke â€” Rancher Kubernetes Engine Rancher2 is the shiny web interface and API everybody talks about. rke is the Kubernetes installer which you used to create Kubernetes clusters with when using Rancher.\nIt is rke which does the magic in Rancher. Rancher is packed with a certain version of rke. If you just want a Kubernetes Cluster to play with you can use several tools like:\n  kops  kubeadm  kubicorn  minikube  rke (Rancher Kubernetes Engine)  rke is just another method to install and maintain your Kubernetes clusters in the Rancher opinionated way. There are a lot of configuration options. Check the rke docs for more information.\nrke will give you a Kubernetes cluster to work with but not the Rancher web interface! This is somewhat confusing, when you just start.\nYou can always see which Rancher version uses which rke version and therefore the support of the Kubernetes version in the rancher/rancher repository\nHere you can see that rancher v2.2.11 uses rke v0.2.10 and supports up to these Kubernetes version:\n 1.13.12 1.14.10 1.15.11  A good overview for support and all the versions about Rancher can be found in their docs: Rancher Support Matrix\nRancher2 Rancher itself is the Rancher API and web interface which you often see on the internet when someone is referring to Rancher.\nRancher will run on top of your Kubernetes cluster created by rke. You can deploy Rancher via helm to that first rke cluster you created.\nHere is the Rancher Helm Chart and the according documentation on the Rancher website Install Rancher on the Kubernetes Cluster\nSo now you have a Kubernetes cluster with the Rancher 2 helm chart deployed on to. This Cluster should not be used as a Cluster for workloads. Since Rancher comes with rke you can now deploy as many clusters as you like to what location you like.\nRancher Management Cluster and User Cluster Example Rancher/rke will not take care of your general AWS infrastructure like networking. This needs to be taken care of by yourself. I would recommend going with Terraform but AWS Cloudformation and the AWS Console will work as well.\nThe first thing you need is a network and nodes to install a Kubernetes cluster with rke. It would look like Figure 1:\n Example Rancher VPC Setup   There is a lot missing like Internet Gateways, NAT Gatways, routing tables, routes and you could use an Application Load Balancer instead the Network Load Balancer. But you get the idea.\nNext you would need to install Rancher to that Kubernetes cluster which is running on the 3 Rancher nodes. After some DNS configuration and certificates you have a Rancher 2 web interface and API ready to go.\nEasy right? Yeah. I know it is a lot of work. So letÂ´s go on.\nNow you can use the Rancher2 web interface to create your cluster right?\nWrong!\nWe first need another VPC to deploy the Rancher user cluster into. It is mostly the same setup as before but you need a VPC Perring (VPC Gateway is also possible) and you do not need to place EC2 nodes into the cluster. That will be taken care of Rancher.\n Example Rancher VPC Setup with User Cluster   Why do you need the peering? Rancher will ssh into each node and will do the provisioning for each Kubernetes node. Also the created Kubernetes cluster will ping back to Rancher for health checks.\nRancher vocabulary To create the actual user cluster you need to know how Rancher will create those. For that I will explain briefly what Rancher resources you need for the user cluster:\n   Word Description     rke rancher kubernetes engine. A Kubernetes installer in the Rancher way.   Rancher Rancher API and web interface.   Cloud Credentials Credentials to your provider (AWS, Google, Azure, etc.).   Node Templates Definition of Node. Networking, Instance Type, Image, etc.   Node Pool Mapping between Node Role and Node Template when creating a User Cluster.   Node Role Worker, etcd and Control Plane roles for Kubernetes   User Cluster The Cluster created for your actual workload     Cloud Credentials Cloud Credentials is just an AWS Access Key and Access Secret.\nDo not use your user bound AWS credentials!\nWhat will happen, when you deploy your Kubernetes Cluster with the credentials from a user and they leave the company?\n You will deactivate the AWS account because of off boarding Suddenly the cluster does not have proper credentials to interact with the AWS API anymore Finding out will take you some time and can have bad effects like nodes not coming up in AWS  Why do I know that? It is called experience ;-)\nNode Templates Node Templates are just what it says. You define values like:\n VPC subnet EC2 instance type AMI ssh user etc.  As you can see you need a Node Template for every availability zone since subnet in an AWS VPC are bound to an availability zone.\nYou also can use different EC2 instance types for Kubernetes Worker, etcd and control plane.\nIf you are testing out the provisioning and you encounter errors, check that the instance itself is not too small. I did run into it myself and could not figure out what was wrong. Increasing the EC2 instance type to a more performant machine did resolve that issue.\nKubernetes Cluster with Node Pools A Kubernetes cluster in Rancher is made of Node Pools. The Node Pool is just a mapping between the Node Templates and the role in the cluster.\nThe role can be one of the following:\n Worker (will run you workload) etcd (Database for Kubernetes) control Plane (Kubernetes API)  Then you can configure the cluster itself with the right Cloud Provider. This will allow you to use the serviceType LoadBalancer and AWS or other vendors will spawn a Load Balancer for your particular service.\nAlso you can configure your network driver, snapshots and much more.\nRancher Terraform Provider Rancher Labs is also providing an official Rancher2 Terraform Provider. You can create most resources specific to Rancher with that provider. Now you can automate everything with Terraform. From creating the network in AWS up to the cluster in Rancher.\nRancher2 Terraform Provider on the Terraform Website:\nhttps://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/rancher2/index.html\nRancher2 Terraform Provider source at GitHub :\nhttps://github.com/terraform-providers/terraform-provider-rancher2\nrke Terraform Provider There was a Terraform provider made by Kazumichi Yamamoto which I have used in version v0.14.1 to automate the creation of the Rancher management cluster. But I think Rancher has taken over the development of that project and the repository moved to the rancher organization.\n https://github.com/rancher/terraform-provider-rke\nRancher Labs is pretty fast in developing these tools. It will take some time and then the Terraform rke provider will move to the official Terraform providers organization.\nUntil then, you have to download the provider by yourself at rancher-terraform-provider-rke. Only official HashiCorp providers listed here in the terraform-providers GitHub organization will be downloaded for you when running terraform init.\nFinal words Kubernetes itself already is a lot to learn. Put Rancher specific terms to that pile you have even more material to go through. We only did scratch the surface. For this to build you anyway need to learn AWS basics, Kubernetes basics and Rancher basics.\nI hope that helped to understand Rancher running on AWS a little bit better.\n","date":1586774804,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1586969204,"objectID":"a518db00a9b347463c84a1f162af961a","permalink":"https://www.ajfriesen.com/post/rancher-overview/","publishdate":"2020-04-13T12:46:44+02:00","relpermalink":"/post/rancher-overview/","section":"post","summary":"A brief introduction into Rancher, rke and explanation of Rancher specific terms with.
