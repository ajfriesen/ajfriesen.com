Simple website for EliOra Tanzania - Hand in Hand e.V.

This is an organizations which is helping people in Tanzania.
The project is based on donations and volunters.

Since the money and time should not spend on expensive web hosting.
With the static website I build with hugo and the academic theme the only cost are the domain itself.

## Techstack

* The website is build with the static site generator [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) and the [academic theme](https://sourcethemes.com/academic/)
* I am using [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) to host the site and Github Actions to fully automate the process.
