I have worked with Kubernetes the last 2 years on AWS with Rancher2 and just want to jot down some notes.
Kubernetes is not the only thing you need.
It is a whole ecosystem of tools.  
I would have found this kind of resource helpful when I started so maybe this will be to you.

My experience is based mostly on AWS and Rancher2 since at that time EKS was not around.
So I will focus on the tools I know but maybe mention other alternatives.

Topics I consider to write about:
- [x] Rancher
- [ ] Helm
- [ ] Chartmuseum
- [ ] nginx-ingress controller
- [ ] cert-manager
- [ ] kube2iam
- [ ] Grafana
- [ ] prometheus
- [ ] alertmanager
- [ ] cloudwatch-exporter
- [ ] fluentd-cloudwatch
- [ ] kube-state metrics
- [ ] metric-server
- [ ] Tools (kubens & kubectx, kubetail)
- [ ] Docker
