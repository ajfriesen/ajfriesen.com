Simple website for my small passion project.

The main goal is to write content about daily IT problems and explain them for everybody.
The project is inpired by the German project [www.finanztip.de](https://www.finanztip.de/) which explains every financial topic for the normal consumer.

## Techstack

* The website is build with the static site generator [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) and the [academic theme](https://sourcethemes.com/academic/)
* I am using [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) to host the site and Github Actions to fully automate the process.
