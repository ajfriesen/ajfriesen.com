Simple website for my mothers local business in German.
I am not a web developer therefore I am using a [simple onepage theme](https://startbootstrap.com/themes/creative).
With just a few changes the website was done.

I also adminstrate the google maps entry which helps for google searches as well.

Since the website and google maps entry she getÂ´s more potential students interested in piaono lessons.

Have a look here: https://www.klavierschule-friesen.de/

## Next steps

* [ ] Migrate to a hugo hosted side.
  * Better SEO (Search Engine Optimization)
* [ ] Enable Netlify CMS
  * Enable editing the content by the client itself.
