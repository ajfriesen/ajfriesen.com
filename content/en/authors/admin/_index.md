I am living and working in Cologne (Germany) as a Systems Architect.
At work I am creating high available infrastructure with technologies like Kubernetes, AWS, Terraform and a lot more.

When not working I am using my free time to learn Golang which is powering all these awesome tools.

You can find me on several local (Cologne) Meetup groups:

* [Golang Colgone/Bonn](https://www.meetup.com/de-DE/Golang-Cologne/)
* [Kubernetes Meetup Cologne](https://www.meetup.com/de-DE/Kubernetes-Meetup-Cologne/)
* [Cologne AWS User Group #AWSUGCGN](https://www.meetup.com/de-DE/aws-cologne/)

Mid term career goal:

I really like the context of infrastructure and automation.
I am already using modern tools and the tools are more often written in Go.
That is also my personal next objective, to learn Go and using the language in a professional way.
Also I am really interested in working remote in a remote-first company.

If you have something meeting these requirements feel free to contact me.
