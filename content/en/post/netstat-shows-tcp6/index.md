Why netstat shows tcp6 sockets even though you only have ipv4 configured.

<!--more-->

The other day I was building an AWS AMI (Amazon Machine Image) with packer which should run some java software.
The software itself does not matter.

While testing something I just wanted to check for the ports with netstat.
I got this output and was wondering why the ports where of type tcp6.
This was in AWS within a VPC which did not have ipv6 enabled.

```bash
[ec2-user@ip-172-17-9-250 ~]$ sudo netstat -natp
tcp6       0      0 :::8080                 :::*                    LISTEN      3861/java
tcp6       0      0 :::8082                 :::*                    LISTEN      3860/java
tcp6       0      0 127.0.0.1:1527          :::*                    LISTEN      3859/java
tcp6       0      0 :::2181                 :::*                    LISTEN      3858/java
```

I was also able to get a curl running against some web interface from anther machine with curl which only had ipv4 enabled as well.
That means die application itself was answering on ipv4.
Also, I know that ipv4 and ipv6 are not campatible at all.
If you wanted ipv4 server to speak with ipv6 and vice versa you need NAT64[^1], which translates ipv4 and ipv6 traffic.

I was confused...

It turns out the socket itself is an ipv6 socket. I also did not know that there is a special ipv6 address range which maps to ipv4 addresses.[^2]
That means all ipv4 adresses are also ipv6 adresses.[^3]

So these sockets work with ipv4 but since they are really ipv6 sockets they are listed as tcp6 in netstat.

The more you know.
