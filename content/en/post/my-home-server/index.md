Around 2012 or 2013 I did buy myself a Raspberry Pi.
At that time I had no clue about Linux at all.

Why did I buy one?
It was a dirt cheap computer and you could build a decent media center with KODI (xbmc back in the day) and a external hard drive.
That was my cheap and easy student solution for my media.
Awesome, my project was done.

But there is always more to gain!
At some point that hard drive will fill up.
I did read about NAS devices and where pretty much hooked.
I think it was a Synolgy DS213j.
So a two bay NAS.

For some reason I was not happy with is.
You could not do as much on the device.
Do not get me wrong, it did a decent job as a NAS, but that was it.

So I decided to get rid of it (sold it to a friend) and get a real server.

On 09.04.2014 I bought my first server.
And yes this is the only valid date format!

Anyway.
I bought a HP ProLiant MicroServer G7 N54L for ~160â‚¬.
Why?
I always had the dream of a media PC.
So 

Is that interesting for somebody?
I do not know.
I only know that this piece of hardware was one of my best investments in regards of learning.

Back in the day there was not a lot of streaming of any kind in Germany.
As a student you anyway could not afford that.
