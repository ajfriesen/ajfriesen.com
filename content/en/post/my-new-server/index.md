My old HP ProLiant MicroServer N54L is getting a little slow for me and I wanted to build a new server.

So lets get down the rabbit whole, shall we?

## Requirements:

* More cores: The two cores without HyperThreading and no Turboboost where just to slow for the docker containers I am running on that machine
* IPMI: I do want to have the possibility to debug the machine without attaching a Monitor with VGA
* PCI Express slots to use a simple HBA
* Space for 2 SSDs for the OS in mirror raid
* Extra space for at least 7 x 3.5" sata drives (does not need to be hotswap)

## Research

I decided to go with used enterprise hardware just because of price.
Even if you can get a lot of cores nowadays in consumer hardware as well today with the new AMD CPUs I did not want to spend to much on this.

I also did find a really good resource for home server builds on [https://www.serverbuilds.net/](https://www.serverbuilds.net/).
The [serverbuilds forum](https://forums.serverbuilds.net/) is worth a look and especially the guides like the [NAS Killer 4.0 - fast, quiet, power efficient, and flexible - starting at $125](https://forums.serverbuilds.net/t/guide-nas-killer-4-0-fast-quiet-power-efficient-and-flexible-starting-at-125/667).
So much good information to get started.
It helped me a lot since I personally work with __the cloud__ and do not with hatdware and that got me up to speed.

Initially I wanted to go with the Haswell-based Xeons because the motherboards for this generation with the [LGA 1150](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LGA_1150) socket do have USB 3.0 build in and more modern display connections and not only VGA.
Also the prices on ebay and the local classifieds were okay for this hardware.

## But then I got lucky

Unfortunalty I got this hardware for just ~20â‚¬, but I had to carry it by myself in the tram.
That thing was **really heavy**!

* Motherboard: [Supermicro X9SCM-F](https://www.supermicro.com/products/motherboard/Xeon/C202_C204/X9SCM-F.cfm)
* CPU: [Intel XEON E3-1240 v2](https://ark.intel.com/content/www/de/de/ark/products/65730/intel-xeon-processor-e3-1240-v2-8m-cache-3-40-ghz.html)
* Memory: 4x ATP 8GB DDR3-1600 ECC
* Cooler: Cooler Master Hyper TX3i
* Powersupply: Seasonic SS-650HT Active PFC F3
* Extra: A huuuuuge case with some fans and a raid controller which I do not want to use (does not support HBA IT Mode)

Pretty neat and way better than my current setup.

The things I had to do:

- Reset the IPMI password
- Replace the cmos battery
- Clean the board and other components
- Replace thermal paste
- Buy a new CPU fan, the old one was broken
- Update IPMI firmware
- Update the BIOS to newest version
- Get a a new smaler case which I had to do anyway
  - I did choose the [Fractal Design Node 804](https://www.fractal-design.com/products/cases/node/node-804/black/)
  - It looks nice on the desk and has a lot of space for drives (10 x 3.5")
- Get rid of the old case (way to big for my flat)

## Buildprocess

Plenty of space in the left chamber.

The two drive cages can hold up to 4 x 3.5" HDDs.
The HDDs do have enough space for airflow inbetween but the cable was somewaht tight!
