I have on of these handy dandy little HDD toasters.
I just wanted to create some cold backups.
Never used that thing as almost everybody (I know you did not :wink:)

Why?
I am to lazy, since it was always a manuall process.
That changes now with automounting the LUKS drive with udev and systemd and run a backup script.
Flipping a switch once in a while should be doable even for me.

<!--more-->

## The goal

1. Flip the power switch on that toaster (the HDDs is always inside in on of the slots)
2. Automatlicy decrypt the LUKS device
3. Mount the btrfs filesystem
4. Copy some data with a backup script
5. Unmount after the backup has finished
6. Encrypt the disk again
7. Maybe some sort of notification so that I know, that I can safely swich off the HDD toaster (Not done yet)

The drive already is encrypted with LUKS2 and has a btrfs filesystem.
This will not be covered.

## Create the udev rule for the specifc device

The udev documentation is not that pleasant to read and somehow I feel the information is gathered all over the palce.
So I started on the arch wik about udev [^1].
This got me to the *writing udev rules* articel[^3] which is good for understanding the conecpt.  
Please be carefull since some information on that article is outdated.
An example: In the article `udevinfo` is used to gather information about the device.
This tool is no longer available at least in arch linux and I think the succsessor is `udevadm`.

I also found a german blog post [^2] about some simliar usecase where somebody wants to mount an encrypted SD card with udev.
Maybe this is worth a read.

So let us start with my device.
Gather some specific information for my HDD:

```bash
udevadm info -q all -n /dev/sdk
P: /devices/pci0000:00/0000:00:01.1/0000:02:00.0/usb4/4-2/4-2.3/4-2.3:1.0/host7/target7:0:0/7:0:0:0/block/sdk

I would like to use these two fields since those look specifc enogh for my device.
```
E: ID_SERIAL=ST8000AS0002-1NA17Z_Z840YC3T
E: ID_SERIAL_SHORT=Z840YC3T
```

I tried using them in my udev rule like this:  
`ATTRS{ID_SERIAL}=="ST8000AS0002-1NA17Z_Z840YC3T"`  
`ATTRS{ID_SERIAL_SHORT}=="Z840YC3T"`

Unforunatly this did not work.
I am still not sure why.

After some research I found this command:

```bash
udevadm info -a -p $(udevadm info -q path -n /dev/sdk)

Udevadm info starts with the device specified by the devpath and then
walks up the chain of parent devices. It prints for every device
found, all possible attributes in the udev rules key format.
A rule to match, can be composed by the attributes of the device
and the attributes from one single parent device.

```

With this I could find at least the **ATTRS{vendor}=="ST8000AS"** which is kind of unique for my setup.
If you search for this string on the internet you get the model number for my HDD.
Since I only have this one it is okay for my usecase right now.  
When I happen to buy another one of these I have to be carefull not to automaticly use the wrong HDD.
Good that my LUKS encryption will not allow that unless I am using the same LUKS key.

So with that I did write the follwing udev rule:

{{< gist ajfriesen 1e4519efa809db4b452543bcf89950fe "10-local.rules" >}}

This will start the configured systemd service when the drive with that specific attributes is added to the system.

{{% callout note %}}
When testing udev rule start as simple as possible.
Something like this:
```
KERNEL=="sd*", ACTION=="add", SUBSYSTEM=="block", ENV{SYSTEMD_WANTS}="backup-decrypt-mount.service"
```
So that you know something will happen.  
Going further only change one thing at a time.
Otherwise you will go nuts on the debugging process.
{{% /callout %}}

{{% callout warning %}}
systemd version!

My version:
```bash
systemctl --version
systemd 245 (245.5-2-arch)
```
Some distros do have a way older systemd version installed and systemd has a lot of breaking changes.
Sometimes a option has just changed by name.
The systemd documentation is really bad at giving you a specific version.
I believe it is always showing you the latest release.  
You can always use `man systemd` on your host to check what is valid for your system.
{{% /callout %}}

So letÂ´s move to systemd then.

## Create a systemd service

Why systemd, when all the decrpytion and mounting logik could be handeld by the backup script below?
You do not have to think about logging since everything in stdout and stderr is in journalctl.
The setup is easier to understand than a complex bash script which grows beyond understanding.
I like the KISS principle here because my future self will thank me for the easy to understand way rather than for the geniuis complex one.

With `Type=oneshot` we just run this service once without creating a daemon or some background process.
With `	RemainAfterExit=no` the service will stop itself with the ExecStop commands.

{{< gist ajfriesen 1e4519efa809db4b452543bcf89950fe "backup-to-hdd.service" >}}

Do not forget to enable the systemd service with:
```
systemctl enable backup-to-hdd.service
```

## Backup script

My arch linux is running on a SSD.
All my docker applications like nextcloud run on the same SSD as the system.
The server also has some Western Digital Reds used as a btrfs raid which is mostly used for media.
Since there is still a lot of space left I also want to copy my data (like nextcloud) to that raid.
In case something happens to my system SSD.
And that is what `home/andrej/raidpool/backup` is for (`"${SOURCE}"`).

The raid is part of that server and therefore always online.
The HDD in the toaster on the other hand is only available to the system when the backup job is running.

With a really simple script which is easy to customize and understand we can copy the data to my HDD.

{{< gist ajfriesen 1e4519efa809db4b452543bcf89950fe "backup-to-hdd.sh" >}}

The "${DESTINATION}" is the mountpoint and folder for my HDD in that toaster.
The idea behind that is having a cold storage which is not always connected to the server and also may be stored in another building.
(Good luck with that when working from home :wink:)

## Conclusion

With this setup there is no way I am missing the weekly or montly backup for my offline device.
I hope this gives you the courage to get out that toast and put your HDD toaster into proper useage.
Have fun and have a backup!
