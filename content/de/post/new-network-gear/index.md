I was thinking about new network equipnet for some time now.
Due to a planned shoulder surgery on 15th of March I was not able and allowed to work for some time.

First few days were aslo pretty rough but soon I did not have much pain anymore and so my head was spinning around new network equipment.

Current setup is just the popular (in Germany) Router FritzBox, in my case the FritzBox 6490 Cable, a couple of cheap non-managed switches (TP-Link) and a Fritz Repeater 2400.

This works relativly good but some time some really weird problems started to happen.
My home server was not reachable anymore via ssh and also othr services like home assitant did not work anymore.
But I  could still use IPMI to access the host.
