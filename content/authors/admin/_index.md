I am living and working in Colgone (Germany) as a Systems Architect.
At work I am creating high available infrastructure with technoligies like Kubernets, AWS, Terraform and a lot more.

When not working I am using my free time to learn Golang which is powering all these awesome tools.

You can find me on several local (Cologne) Meetup groups:

* [Golang Colgone/Bonn](https://www.meetup.com/de-DE/Golang-Cologne/)
* [Kubernetes Meetup Cologne](https://www.meetup.com/de-DE/Kubernetes-Meetup-Cologne/)
* [Cologne AWS User Group #AWSUGCGN](https://www.meetup.com/de-DE/aws-cologne/)

The position should also be a remote only position in a remote first company.
